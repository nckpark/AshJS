# AshJS

Javascript port of the Ash entity system framework for game development, originally written in ActionScript 3 and available at [ashframework.org](http://www.ashframework.org/). 

For more information on entity systems, read Ash author Richard Lord's post [What is an entity system framework for game development?](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/what-is-an-entity-framework)

Classes follow the module pattern, developed for use with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). See the demo game ashteroidsJS for an example of use.

Unit tests written with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). Open SpecRunner.html to run.
